# reading-list

This is a list to track what I have read. 

Over the years I have been keeping lists in different places and different formats. I think using git provides the simplest (plain text based) and the most efficient way to track my reading. [Jamie Rubin's post](https://www.jamierubin.net/2015/06/27/maintaining-my-reading-list-as-a-github-repo-using-atom-1-0/) inspired to me create this repo and start using it regularly. I am also borrowing the format from Jamie (with some slight changes, the format will be simple, no hyperlinks): 

```
<number>.[space]<title> by <author>;[space]<date_finished/YYYY/MM/DD> 
```
This simple format will be useful to parse the text and process it later if needed. The list will be primarily for books in print (maybe I will create a separate list for articles and papers). And I like the idea of using the commit message for comments. 

I use the command line and Linux tools for my work so most of the list maintenance will be done in [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) and [MacDown]([https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) then git commit, push. For now, it will be just one [reading.md](https://github.com/sharifX/reading-list/blob/master/reading.md) file -- starting from Oct 2019. I will need to see how to gather the old reading lists and migrate it here. I have read (maybe not all of them cover to cover) gazillion books during my [disseration](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/92730) research years but not sure if I will migrate those here. 

I still write book reviews once in a while but they will be posted om my [blog](https://medium.com/@sharif.islam).
